# Cross bars
Interactively visualize crossing-over blocks in F1s from SNPs of progeny and parents

You have sequenced and called SNPs for parents and their descendents. Where do the descendents' SNP profiles look like parent 1 and where do they look like parent 2? This tool will provide an interactive visualization.
